# Application for working time management

In the application you can register your organization. After registration, you can create users who are part of 
the organization and assign them roles: "Employee", "Manager". The manager gives tasks to the employees. 
Employees can see the tasks on their Tasks page and get involved in the work. 
After completion of the task, the employee can send a report on the work performed in the "Reports" section.
